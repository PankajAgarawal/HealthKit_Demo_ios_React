/**
 *  Creates an instance of the configuration object for the ecg monitor.
 *  @param deviceType The kind of hardware device that generated the recording.
 *  @param leadsConfig The recording mode applied to the device.
 *  @param filterType The filter setting for the ecg real time preview.
 *  @param maxDuration The maximum duration of the ECG recording that should be used by ECG monitor (ACKEcgMonitorViewController). If maxDuration is not explicitly defined, the default value would be 30 seconds.
 *  @param frequency The frequency of the power grid where the ECG was recorded One of {ACKMainsFilter50Hz, ACKMainsFilter60Hz}. If the frequency is not explicitly defined, the default value would be ACKMainsFrequency60Hz
 *  @param sampleRate The sampling frequency of the signal. If the sampleRate is not explicitly defines, the default value would be 300
 *  @param minDuration The minimum duration of the ECG recording. The default value is 10 seconds, if the ECG is less then this time, the recording would be reset.
 *  @param error The error object.
 *  @return An instance of the recording object. Returns nil if an invalid source option
 *  is specified in respect to the specified source. E.g., A Band source with a
 *  triangleSingleLeadAmbulatory source option would fail initialization or if invalid api key is used.
